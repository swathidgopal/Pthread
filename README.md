# Pthread
Here we write a single core user-level thread library and implement 2 different variations of popular scheduler policies. These policies are commonly known as MLFQ and STCF. The goal was
to be able to use this thread library to mimic the pthread library, in which a user may create multiple threads, create and utilize mutexes, and customize the scheduler to follow one of the 2 dierent paradigms.
